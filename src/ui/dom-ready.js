 * DS Comments — DOM-ready helper.
 *
 * Run `attach(sendForm)` once #send_form is available. #send_form is core
 * SillyTavern UI, guaranteed present by the time event_types.APP_READY fires
 * (script.js firstLoadInit: initExtensions() -> APP_INITIALIZED ->
 * initLoaderHandle.hide() -> fixViewport() -> APP_READY). If #send_form
 * already exists (post-ready enable, or APP_READY already fired), attach
 * synchronously; otherwise subscribe to APP_READY and attach on the event.
 *
 * Polling is deliberately avoided: waiting on APP_READY instead of a timer
 * gives event-driven attach with no deadline. Idempotent: safe to call on
 * every init; the caller guards its own observer with a once-flag.
 *
 * Returns a disposer: callers (window.js, index.js) MUST store it and invoke
 * it in their teardown path. Without this, an extension disabled BEFORE
 * APP_READY leaves the listener alive, and the later event attaches orphaned
 * ResizeObserver/MutationObserver + launcher button after teardown.
